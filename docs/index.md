# fastapi-activitypub

Ultralightweight ActivityPub server implementation with FastAPI and Pyoxigraph <3

Lovingly adapted from some of the bones of [microblog.pub](https://docs.microblog.pub/).

Making the first (that i'm aware of) AP implementation that actually is built on RDF
instead of just faking it with RDBMS lol (no shade)

(obvi just a stub rn)

- [ ] Do literally anything!
- [ ] Import and adapt models from microblog.pub
- [ ] Then you know implement the rest of the owl
